# TravelWeather-Project2

A website that allows the user to search for their Christmas travel destination, assess the temperature forecast average for the Christmas holiday based on the GFS American weather model run from December 17th, and then run through a scrapping function that will suggest some ‘appropriate’ outfits given the forecasted climate.

To perform the tasks, we utilized csv provided data from a weather vendor, Commodity Weather Group, transformed it in our flask to JSON and then some GEOJSON formatted data, and ran several JS libraries that includes Turf.JS, Mapbox GL, featuring Geocoder.
